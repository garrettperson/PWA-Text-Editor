# Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Text Editor

  ## Description
  My motivation in building this project was to learn more about progressive web applications. I built this project to create a text editor application that can function both online and offline. This project solves the problem of needing a reliable text editor that functions offline. I learned more about progressive web applications, indexedDB, webpack, and service workers.

  ## Website

  https://pwa-text-editor-3-y650.onrender.com/

  ## Usage

  To use the project one simply enters text on a given line. Deploying from Render seems to have caused some difficulties - one may need to do the following steps to resolve the issue:

  Right-click on the page
  Select 'Inspect'
  Navigate to 'Applications'
  Select 'Service Workers'
  Select 'Unregister'

  That should resolve any difficulties if the text does not persist with refreshing the page.
