# Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Text Editor

  ## Description
  My motivation in building this project was to learn more about progressive web applications. I built this project to create a text editor application that can function both online and offline. This project solves the problem of needing a reliable text editor that functions offline. I learned more about progressive web applications, indexedDB, webpack, and service workers.
